Mach-O-Scope 0.2

Mach-O-Scope is a browser of the disassemble of Mach-O Bundles (OS X Applications, plugins etc)
It uses otool and OTX to dump the assembly (ppc, i386 and x86_64) of an executable, add symbols, and break down the code into classes and methods.
Mach-O-Scope the stores the data in a sqlite3 database and provides a convenient front end to browsing and searching the disassembly.

Notes made on Methods and operations will automatically be saved for future references.

Limitations
	Mach-O-scope currently does not properly handle C functions or blocks.  This is planned.
